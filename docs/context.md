# Overview

`powerkeys` is a keyboard runtime for web apps that need more than a few flat
`keydown` listeners. It gives you declarative bindings, layered scopes,
multi-step sequences, `when` clauses, shortcut recording, atomic rebinding
through binding sets, and a shared availability check for external actions.

The important boundary is this:

- `powerkeys` owns keyboard matching, dispatch, recording, and evaluation of
  `scope` plus `when`.
- Your app owns commands, command-palette items, UI state, persistence, and any
  metadata such as title, group, or search keywords.

If you already have a command model, `powerkeys` should plug into it. The usual
shape is to keep the action in your app, reuse its `scope` and `when` when you
attach a shortcut, and call `isAvailable` when a palette or menu needs to know
whether that action currently makes sense.

# When to Use

Use `powerkeys` when your app needs one or more of these:

- layered shortcut scopes such as modal over editor over root
- shortcuts that depend on app state such as selection, mode, or read-only
- multi-step sequences such as `g g` or `g i`
- user-recordable shortcut expressions
- shortcuts derived from persisted user preferences or other mutable app state
  that need atomic replacement
- one source of truth for shortcut eligibility and external action availability
- a DOM boundary narrower than the whole document

# When Not to Use

`powerkeys` is a poor fit when you need one or more of these instead:

- OS-level or browser-global shortcuts outside the current document
- a full command system or palette framework that already owns keyboard input
- direct DOM listeners with no meaningful state, scope, or conflict rules
- a library that should own your command registry, menu model, or UI rendering

# Core Abstractions

`ShortcutRuntime`

- Create one with `createShortcuts({ target, ... })`.
- It owns event listeners, binding registration, runtime context, recording, and
  availability checks.

Bindings

- A binding is either one combo such as `Mod+k` or a sequence such as `g g`.
- A binding always has a handler.
- A binding may also declare `scope`, `when`, `priority`,
  `editablePolicy`, `keyEvent`, and event-consumption behavior.

Scopes

- Active scopes come from `getActiveScopes`.
- Earlier scopes have higher precedence.
- `root` is always appended, so unscoped bindings and actions remain eligible.
- Scopes are the coarse filter for "which layer of the app is active right
  now?"

`when` Clauses

- A `when` clause is a boolean expression evaluated against runtime context.
- Use it for finer-grained state such as `editor.hasSelection &&
  !editor.readOnly`.
- `when` clauses can be shared between your own action objects and shortcut
  bindings.

Runtime Context

- Write context with `setContext` or `batchContext`.
- Built-in namespaces are `event`, `scope`, `runtime`, and `context`.
- User context is also spread onto the top level, so `editor.hasSelection` is
  readable directly in a `when` clause.

Availability Checks

- `isAvailable({ scope, when })` answers whether an external action is currently
  eligible.
- The input is structural. Extra fields on your own action objects are ignored.
- `isAvailable` evaluates only shared availability concerns. It does not know
  about command ids, palette sections, search text, or rendering.
- For external checks, the `event` namespace is inert: `event.key` and
  `event.code` are `undefined`, and modifier booleans are `false`.

Recording

- `record()` captures canonical shortcut expressions from live input.
- Recording is separate from registration. The common flow is: record, persist
  the expression, then later bind it directly or swap it into a `BindingSet`.

Binding Sets

- Create one with `shortcuts.createBindingSet()`.
- A binding set owns a mutable collection of bindings that can be replaced as
  one unit.
- `replace(nextBindings)` validates the whole next collection before swapping
  it into place.
- Failed replacement leaves the current bindings unchanged.
- Successful replacement drops any in-progress sequence state owned by the
  previous set contents.

# Data Flow / Lifecycle

1. Create a runtime with a document or element `target`.
2. Keep your app's real state in your app, and mirror only the parts relevant to
   shortcut eligibility into runtime context.
3. Return active scopes from `getActiveScopes` in precedence order.
4. Register bindings with `bind` for static shortcuts or
   `shortcuts.createBindingSet()` for derived shortcut collections that need
   atomic replacement.
5. If your app has its own command or action objects, put shared availability on
   those objects with `scope` and `when`.
6. Reuse that same `scope` and `when` when attaching a keyboard shortcut.
7. Call `isAvailable` when an external surface such as a command palette needs
   to know whether an action should be offered right now.
8. Dispose the runtime when the owning UI subtree or application shuts down.

# Common Tasks -> Recommended APIs

Open a command palette

- `bind({ combo: "Mod+k", preventDefault: true, handler })`

Keep modal shortcuts above editor shortcuts

- `getActiveScopes: () => ["modal", "editor"]`
- Bind modal and editor actions to the same combo with different scopes

Gate a shortcut on app state

- `setContext("editor.hasSelection", true)`
- `bind({ combo: "c", when: "editor.hasSelection", handler })`

Share availability rules with an external command palette

- Put `scope` and `when` on your own action object
- `isAvailable(action)` before rendering or invoking it from the palette
- Reuse that same `scope` and `when` in `bind({ ..., handler })`

Register multi-step navigation

- `bind({ sequence: "g g", handler })`
- Adjust `sequenceTimeout` when the default one-second window is not right for
  your app

Temporarily disable keyboard shortcuts

- `pause(scope)` and `resume(scope)`
- Omit the scope to pause or resume the whole runtime
- `pause` affects keyboard dispatch only. It does not make external actions
  unavailable to `isAvailable`

Let users choose their own shortcut

- `record({ onUpdate, suppressHandlers: true })`
- Save the returned `ShortcutRecording.expression`
- Rebind that expression later with `bind` or `BindingSet.replace`

Rebind a user-configurable shortcut set

- `const userBindings = shortcuts.createBindingSet()`
- Recompute your next object-form bindings in app code
- `userBindings.replace(nextBindings)` to swap them atomically

Debug why a shortcut did not fire

- `explain(event)` to inspect scope, matcher, and `when`-clause decisions

# Recommended Patterns

- Keep your command or action model in your app, and treat `powerkeys` as the
  keyboard and availability layer.
- Use one long-lived `BindingSet` when shortcuts are derived from mutable app
  state or persisted user preferences and must be replaced as one unit.
- Use scopes for major UI layers such as modal, editor, sidebar, and root.
- Use `when` for state that changes frequently inside one scope, such as
  selection state or read-only mode.
- Reuse one `scope` plus `when` rule across all invocation surfaces for the same
  action.
- Mirror only decision-making state into runtime context. If a value does not
  affect eligibility, it probably does not belong there.

# Patterns to Avoid

- Do not build palette presentation concerns such as group names, labels, or
  search keywords into `powerkeys`.
- Do not use `pause` as a visibility switch for menus or palettes. It is a
  keyboard-only control.
- Do not rebuild one dynamic shortcut collection with manual unbind and rebind
  loops when one `BindingSet` can own that collection.
- Do not make shared availability depend on keyboard-event details such as
  `event.key` or modifier state.
- Do not duplicate the same eligibility rule in separate shortcut-only and
  palette-only code paths when one shared `scope` plus `when` clause will do.
- Do not treat `getActiveScopes` as a place for fine-grained state that belongs
  in `when`.

# Invariants and Constraints

- `root` is always active, even when `getActiveScopes` returns nothing.
- Each binding must define exactly one of `combo` or `sequence`.
- Only one recording session may be active per runtime.
- Only one binding wins a given event.
- `BindingSet.replace` is atomic: invalid next bindings do not partially update
  the active set.
- Editable targets are blocked by default.
- Reserved top-level context names are `context`, `event`, `scope`, and
  `runtime`.
- Sequence state expires after `sequenceTimeout` milliseconds of inactivity.
- `pause` and `resume` are reference-counted, so repeated pauses require
  matching resumes.

# Error Model

- Invalid binding definitions throw synchronously during `bind` or
  `BindingSet.replace`.
- Failed `BindingSet.replace` calls leave the set unchanged.
- Invalid `when` syntax also throws synchronously during `isAvailable`.
- Handler errors are sent to `onError` when provided; otherwise they are
  rethrown asynchronously.
- `when`-clause evaluation errors during dispatch do not throw through the
  native event handler. They cause that binding to fail its `when` check, and
  the error appears in `explain`.
- `when`-clause evaluation errors inside `isAvailable` return `false`.
- Recording `onUpdate` errors are reported through `onError` and do not cancel
  the active recording.
- Cancelling a recording rejects `RecordingSession.finished` with an
  `AbortError`.

# Terminology

- **Combo**
  - One key press plus zero or more modifiers, such as `Ctrl+k` or `Meta+/`.

- **Sequence**
  - Whitespace-separated combo steps, such as `g g`.

- **Scope**
  - A named dispatch layer used to decide which bindings or external actions are
    eligible before `when` clauses run.

- **When Clause**
  - A boolean expression evaluated against runtime context to make a final
    eligibility decision.

- **Boundary**
  - The document or element passed as `target`, which limits which native events
    the runtime considers.

- **Editable Policy**
  - The rule that decides whether a binding may run while focus is inside an
    editable element.

- **Binding Set**
  - A runtime-owned collection of bindings that can be replaced, cleared, or
    disposed as one unit.

# Non-Goals

- global shortcuts outside the current DOM boundary
- command registration or command identifiers owned by `powerkeys`
- command-palette or menu rendering
- framework-specific hooks or adapters
